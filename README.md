*AIM:*
Generate a random number “n” between [5-10], create a matrix of size nxn

Populate the locations with “0” and “1” [the self-loops should be avoided]

Write the program to check and declare:
a) Complete graph is cyclic
b) Part of the graph is cyclic
c) Write the cycle in terms of vertices.

Constraint: the cycle should be of minimum THREE vertices or MAXIMUM “n” vertices.
